// Create a function that takes an array of card numbers and checks if the sum of their value exceeds 21 
// or is equal to 21. 

//Values of the cards are as follows:
// 2-10 are their value.
// J-K (face cards) count as 10.
// Aces count as 1 or 11 - if counting an Ace as 11 would bring the total over 21, count it as 1.

// If the count is exactly 21 return 'Blackjack!'

/**
 *
 * @param {Array} cards mixed array of numbers and strings 
 *
 * @returns {boolean | string} true if sum exceeds 21, false if sum is under or equal to 21, 'Blackjack!' if sum is exactly 21
