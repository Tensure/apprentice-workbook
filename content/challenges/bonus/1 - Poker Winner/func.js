/**
 * This function calculates the winning poker hand from a given set of hands for Texas Hold'em.
 *
 * The function follows these steps:
 * 1. Parse each hand to identify the rank and suit of each card.
 * 2. Evaluate the strength of each hand based on poker hand rankings (e.g., Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, etc.).
 * 3. Compare the evaluated hands to determine the highest-ranking hand.
 * 4. In case of a tie, use the highest card in the tied hands to determine the winner.
 * 5. Return the winning hand.
 *
 * A set of hands could look like this: [["2C", "10S"], ["5H", "AD"]]  (2C = 2 of Clubs, 10S = 10 of Spades, 5H = 5 of Hearts, AD = Ace of Diamonds)
 *
 * tableCards will always have 5 cards such as: ["2C", "10S", "5H", "AD", "KS"]
 *
 * If you see two cards on the board that are the same, return "CHEATER!"
 *
 * The function assumes that the input is a valid set of poker hands and that the standard poker hand rankings are used.
 *
 * @param {Array.<string>} tableCards - An array of strings representing the cards on the table
 * @param {Array.<Array.<string>>} hands - An array of poker hands, where each hand is represented as an array of strings
 *
 * @returns {Array} - The winning poker hand.
