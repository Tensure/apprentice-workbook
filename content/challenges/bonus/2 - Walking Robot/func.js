// Create the code for a robot that will move to any x, y coordinate provided.
// The robot will always start at 0, 0.
// The robot will be given an array of x, y coordinates to move to.
// We need to return the total distance that the robot moved while following the coordinates.
// We also need to know the distance the robot is from the starting point of 0, 0.
// You will need to use the mathematical formula for calculating the distance between two points.
// You will need to use some functions from javascript's Math object.
